Done
- Reacctivity using Signals + Auto cleanup + Deep Proxy (Default)
    - [UPDATE] Thanks to "zulu" from the Solid.js Discord for helping out in debugging a comparison error between Proxied object. Two different proxy pointing to the same object. The fix was to use JS Symbols to check if the new value being set is an existing Proxy to prevent any duplicate proxy from being created

- {{#if}}, {{#each}}, {{#await}}
    - [UPDATE] {{#each}} is such a pain in the ass to implement

- {{ expression... }}

- onMount, unMount
    - [UPDATE] first implementation lack, multiple onmount and unmount support

- Components
    - Open and/or close tag
    - Slots for Components
    - Component props as attributes
        - [UPDATE] modified regex to include function expressions

- Per text reactivity
    - [UPDATE] failed to do so, fuck that shit
    - [UPDATE] finally got it to work!

Yet to implement
- Two-way data binding (bind:[attribute])
- Custom directives (use:[function])
